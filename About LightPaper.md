###★ New in Version 1.4

---

*LightPaper* is a simple, beautiful, text and Markdown editor for passionate writers. You can use *LightPaper* to write any kind of text documents - blogs, articles, notes, READMEs, TODOs, or the next chapter of your new novel. Its simple interface gets out of your way, allowing you to focus on writing. Your mobile editing experience will be enriched with the help of undo/redo, spell checking, and quick movement keys. To remove distractions, you can switch to *Distraction Free Mode* to completely immerse yourself in your current paragraph.

## Dropbox Integration
The documents are saved locally by default, with the option to sync with and upload your documents to the cloud through Dropbox. To link to Dropbox, click Menu on the ActionBar, select `Settings`, and click `Add New Accounts`.

## Markdown Support
*LightPaper* comes with built-in support for Markdown syntax. If you don't know Markdown and don't want to, it's okay - you can write everything in plain text. But we highly recommend you spare a few minutes to learn more about Markdown following this link: <http://links.clockworkengine.com/mkdn>.

From the author of Markdown:

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

### Previewing Markdown Document
If you have formatted your document using Markdown, previewing your document is just one swipe away - just swipe from right to left. To switch back to edit mode, swipe from left to right.
