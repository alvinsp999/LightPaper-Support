###Settings
Enter settings from the menu.  In settings, you can add accounts (*DropBox*, *Wordpress*, or *Tumblr*).  Also in settings, you can set the default sort direction, change how tab characters are interpreted, choose a default sharing method, and check out the latest R&D projects we're working on in the *Labs* area.

A note on *Labs*:  Any feature in Labs is one that we're testing.  If you find one useful, be certain to let us know.
