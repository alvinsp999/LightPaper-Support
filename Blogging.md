    LightPaper now supports posting your documents directly to WordPress and Tumblr.
    You can add multiple WordPress or Tumblr blogs
    If you have more than one blog under one account, LightPaper will link all of them.
    You can post to either single or multiple blog accounts at one time
    Required Setup:

    Removing a blog account can be done by going to Settings and clicking the 'x' next to an account

Posting a blog

    Create some awesome content.
    Once you are ready to post, click the menu and select the Blog menu item. If the Blog menu item is disabled, it means you haven't added a blog account yet. Please see section Adding/Removing a blog account.
    From the Select Accounts screen, select at least one blog by clicking the checkbox on the right side and then select Next button
    Type the title for the blog. If you leave this field empty, the name of the document itself will be used.
    Select the status of your blog - DRAFT, QUEUE, PUBLISH or PRIVATE
    Select the format of your blog - HTML or PLAIN (with Markdown)
    Fill TAGS field with comma (,) separated tags. Tags are optional.
    Fill CATEGORIES field with comma (,) separated categories. Categories are only used for WordPress and are ignored for Tumblr. Categories are optional.
    After you have filled the fields, select the Post button. You must be connected to the Internet to be able to successfully post your blog.

NOTE: As of version 1.4, you cannot edit a blog post and resubmit it. Every time you post a blog, a new blog will be created. We strongly recommend you to post your blog as a DRAFT, do final editing online and change the status to PUBLISHED from there.
