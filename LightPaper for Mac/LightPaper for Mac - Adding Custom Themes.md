##Adding Custom Themes to [LightPaper for Mac](clockworkengine.com/lightpaper-mac/?ref=themedocshare)


You can write your own themes or use already available themes by just dropping them under `~/.lightpaper/Themes` directory. You can also put themes under a subdirectory as well as just clone a repo and **LightPaper for Mac** will pick them up without any extra efforts on your side. Files ending in `.txt` are counted as editor themes while files ending in `.css` are counted as preview themes. 


Here are some of the themes that are already available publicly on github that you can use right away:

1. [Dashing Theme by @designerJordan](https://github.com/designerJordan/md-dashing-theme)
2. [Theme by hzlzh](https://github.com/hzlzh/Mou-Theme)
3. [Clearness Dark Plus by Staudi](https://github.com/Staudi/Clearness-Dark-Plus)
4. [Byword Theme by kvanlierop](https://github.com/kvanlierop/byword-for-mou)
5. [Kublai Theme by moizk](https://github.com/moizk/kublai-mou)

Clone one or all of the above themes under `~/.lightpaper/Themes` and you are all set. You can select a theme for the editor and/ or for the preview from the Preferences pane (`LightPaper>Preferences…` or `⌘,`). If two themes share the same name, only one of them will be picked. If you want to write your own theme, we recommend you to use one of the above mentioned themes as a template.
